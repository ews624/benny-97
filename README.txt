Welcome to
  Worm the Game: Who Up Playing With It?

This game was inspired by a man named Kasen,
who was often up playing with his worm and
curious if others were doing the same. May
he rest in piece.

First I should mention that is game is
intended to be run on linux or mac systems
easily from the command line. If you use
windows, try running the game in a linux
subsystem. You will need the GNU Fortran
compiler to compile the source code if you
do not have the executable.

Start by filling out 'worm.par' to create
your character. If you try to cheat the game
will not run. When you lie, cheat, and steal,
I get intolerant.

Afterwards, run the exe at the command line:
  gooner@goon-cave-machine:~/path/to/worm$ ./worm
Make sure that 'worm.par' is in the same folder
as the executable. Failure to do this will call
the 12th Man to your doorstep and he will eat
your asswhole.
